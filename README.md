# Creep It Real
## Our 2022 Demon Hackathon Project
### Introduction:
Creep It Real is an interactive website that generates Halloween costume ideas based on user input. The user is prompted by a series of options which they selected and based on their selected options an output is generated.

This repository contains:
1. JS script
2. CSS styles
3. Index html and main website
4. "adult" and "children" file folders contain the images that are displayed based on user selections
5. Pngs of header, logos, buttons, and avatars

### Architecture:
Html, CSS, JS

### Layout:
Opening the website shows the user the header with "Creep It Real" logo as well as brown "Get Started" button. Clicking on the button creates loading screen with a pumpkin graphic and loading wheel. The user is taken to the options page where they are prompted to click option buttons. As they click the preferred buttons the avatar fills based on the percentage of their progress. Once the avatar fills completely, a generate button appears. Upon clicking the generate button the avatar is replaced with an image based on response and text description. A "Back to Homepage" will be available at the bottom for users to repeat the process.
